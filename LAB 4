#1.	Record the length of the ages List in a variable (you'll need it later)
#length = len(ages)
    #print(length)

#2.	Display these ages one on each line
#for num in ages:
    #print (num)

#3.	Add one year to every age!
#for num in range(len(ages)):
    #ages[num] +=1 
#print (ages)

#4.	Our code only takes into account those people in the age range of 16-65 (inclusively)

#for num in ages:
    #if num not in range(16,66):
        #ages.remove(num)
#print(ages)

#5.	Display the count of 16-25 year olds.

#youngsters = 0

#for num in ages:
    #if num > 15 and num < 26:
        #youngsters +=1
#print(youngsters)

#6.	Invoke the sort method on the ages List. 
#Tip:	 Use this line of code:   ages.sort()
#Display the ages List to make sure they are sorted. 

#ages.sort()
#print (ages)

#7.	What proportion of ages fall between 16-25?
#Test your code by displaying this value.

#youngsters = 0
#others = 0

#for num in ages:
    #if num >15 and num <26:
        #youngsters +=1
    #else: 
        #others +=1
#proportion = youngsters/len(ages)
#print(proportion)

#Count Vowels    
#1.	Add a new file: CountVowels.py and make it the startup file.  


#2.	Inputs a word (a string).
#3.	Counts how many vowels are in the word.   
#Tip: You can scroll through every character of a string in the same way as you do with 	numbers in a range() function. 
#Use a simple if statement/s to detect if the character is 'a', 'e', 'i' 'oâ€™ or  'u'
#Every time you find a vowel you must increase a counter (an integer variable)
#Or (better), you may consider using the 'in' keyword.
#4.	Save and run.

#word = input("Please enter a word:")
#vowels = "aeiou"
#count = 0

#for letter in word:
    #if  letter in vowels:
        #count +=1
#print(count)
